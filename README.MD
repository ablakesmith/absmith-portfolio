# absmith-portfolio

**Name:** Andrew Blake Smith

**Project description:** This project is a portfolio project that I hope to enhance and ultimately use as a resume when looking for software engineering jobs.

**Functionality:** There is linking functionality between the header and the sections of the web page. Additionally, there is a contact form that will send me an email when the submit button is clicked.

**Technologies Used:** HTML & CSS

**Future Improvement:** 
- I will be updating the "projects" & "testimonials" areas as the course goes on and as I need to.
- I need to make it more friendly towards different screen sizes.
- When submitting the contact form, I would like the website to automatically be reloaded and not just stay on the "Thanks! The form was submitted successfully." page.

## User Stories

**Navigation Menu:**
    - As a developer, I want to optimize the navigation menu structure to ensure it's responsive across devices, facilitating seamless user access to different sections of the website.

**Profile Information:**
    - As a developer, I aim to enhance the profile section by potentially incorporating dynamic content loading from a database, enabling easy updates without modifying the HTML directly.

**Skills Section:**
    - As a developer, I intend to modularize the skills section by creating reusable components, allowing for easier additions or modifications to the skill sets in the future.

**Project Showcase:**
    - As a developer, I plan to create a flexible project showcase component, enabling the addition of new projects dynamically with minimal code changes.
        
**Testimonials:**
    - As a developer, I aim to implement a backend system to manage testimonials, facilitating easy additions, deletions, or modifications without altering the HTML structure.

**Contact Form:**
    - As a developer, I prioritize implementing robust validation mechanisms within the contact form to ensure data integrity and security, preventing misuse or spam submissions.
