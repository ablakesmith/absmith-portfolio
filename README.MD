**Name:** Andrew Blake Smith

**Project description:** This project is a portfolio project that I hope to enhance and ultimately use as a resume when looking for software engineering jobs.

**Functionality:** There is linking functionality between the header and the sections of the web page. Additionally, there is a contact form that will send me an email when the submit button is clicked.

**Technologies Used:** HTML & CSS

**Future Improvement:** 
- I will be updating the "projects" & "testimonials" areas as the course goes on and as I need to.
- I need to make it more friendly towards different screen sizes.
- When submitting the contact form, I would like the website to automatically be reloaded and not just stay on the "Thanks! The form was submitted successfully." page
